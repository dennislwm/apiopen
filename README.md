## Hypothesis
**apiopen** was a personal project to:
* design lots of half-baked tiny OpenAPI specs as quickly as possible

---
## Project Structure
     apiopen/                                     <-- Root of your project
       |- .gitignore                              <-- Git ignore file
       |- README.md                               <-- This README markdown file
       +- api_open/                               <-- Holds any exported YAML file from SwaggerHub

---
## Methodology

This is the minimum viable product (MVP) to test the above hypothesis.

### Non-existant viable feature
* design lots of half-baked tiny OpenAPI specs as quickly as possible

### Existing viable feature

* free OpenAPI tool: [My Hub | SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/home)
* free FastAPI tool: [koxudaxi/fastapi-code-generator: This code generator creates FastAPI app from an openapi file.](https://github.com/koxudaxi/fastapi-code-generator)

---
## Complexity

Count the cost of complexity, i.e. incremental reward and risk reduction, before evolving MVP.

### Non-existant bloat
* free tier dynamic webapp host: Heroku, Glitch (Crai2020), Namecheap (Logx2020), Uffizzi

### Existing bloat 
* Nil
